Malicious URLs or malicious website is a very serious threat to cybersecurity. Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by downloads, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. We have collected this dataset to include a large number of examples of Malicious URLs so that a machine learning-based model can be developed to identify malicious urls so that we can stop them in advance before infecting computer system or spreading through inteinternet# Phishing-Domain-Detection-BERT
